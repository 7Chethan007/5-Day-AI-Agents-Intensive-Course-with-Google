# Day 1 — Introduction to Agents

## Overview
This unit introduces AI agents, presenting a taxonomy of agent capabilities and highlighting the need for an Agent Ops discipline to ensure reliability and governance. It also covers agent interoperability and security considerations, including identity and constrained policies.

## Learning Goals
- Understand agent capability taxonomy and common architectures.
- Appreciate Agent Ops practices for reliability, observability, and governance.
- Learn interoperability patterns and security controls for agents.
- Build and evaluate single-agent and multi-agent systems using the ADK and Gemini.

## Required Reading & Listening
- Listen to the Unit 1 summary podcast (created with NotebookLM).
- Read the “Introduction to Agents” whitepaper.

## Codelabs (Kaggle)
Complete the following hands-on labs:
1. Build your first agent using Gemini and the Agent Development Kit (ADK).
2. Build your first multi-agent system using ADK (focus on teams of specialized agents and architectural patterns).

Notes:
- Phone verification on Kaggle is required before starting the codelabs.
- A troubleshooting guide is available for common codelab issues.

## Suggestions
- Add the whitepapers to NotebookLM to enable interactive, conversational exploration of the material.

## Deliverables
- Complete the podcast and whitepaper review.
- Finish both codelabs and resolve any verification/troubleshooting issues.
- Be prepared to discuss architectures and Agent Ops considerations in follow-up sessions.
