This is a truly groundbreaking area!\n\nLet me elaborate on what \"De Novo Drug Design\" means and why generative AI is so impactful here:\n\n**What is De Novo Drug Design?**\n\n*   **\"De Novo\"** is Latin for \"from the beginning\" or \"anew.\"\n*   In drug discovery, traditional methods often involve:\n    *   **Screening existing libraries:** Testing thousands or millions of known chemical compounds to see if any have the desired effect on a biological target. This is like searching for a specific key in a vast pre-existing collection of locks.\n    *   **Modifying existing drugs:** Taking a known drug and tweaking its structure to improve its properties. This is like trying to alter an existing key to fit a slightly different lock.\n*   **De Novo drug design aims to *create* entirely new drug molecules from scratch.** The goal is to design molecules that are not yet known, specifically engineered to fit a particular biological target and possess optimal drug-like properties.\n\n**How Generative AI is Revolutionizing This:**\n\nGenerative AI models are particularly well-suited for de novo drug design because they excel at **learning the underlying patterns and rules of a data distribution and then generating novel samples that resemble that distribution.** In the context of drug discovery, this means:\n\n1.  **Learning the \"Language\" of Chemistry:** Generative AI models are trained on vast datasets of known chemical compounds and their properties. Through this training, they learn:\n    *   **Chemical Grammar:** Which atoms can bond together, what stable molecular structures look like, and what are chemically feasible.\n    *   **Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR):** How specific structural features of a molecule influence its interaction with a biological target (e.g., binding affinity) and its behavior in the body (e.g., solubility, toxicity).\n\n2.  **Generating Novel Molecules:** Once trained, these models can be instructed to generate new molecular structures. This is not random generation; it's guided generation. The AI can be given specific criteria:\n    *   **Target Binding:** \"Design a molecule that will bind strongly to protein X.\"\n    *   **Desired Properties:** \"Design a molecule that is soluble, has a low predicted toxicity, and can pass through cell membranes.\"\n    *   **Novelty:** \"Design a molecule that is structurally distinct from known drugs but still effective.\"\n\n3.  **Types of Generative AI Used:**\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, competing against each other. The generator creates new molecules, and the discriminator tries to distinguish them from real molecules. This adversarial process pushes the generator to create increasingly realistic and promising new compounds.\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (latent space) of molecules and can then decode points from this space to generate new molecules.\n    *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Often combined with generative models, RL can guide the generation process by rewarding the AI for creating molecules that meet specific desired criteria.\n\n**Why is This So Exciting?**\n\n*   **Vastly Increased Chemical Space Exploration:** Traditional methods explore a tiny fraction of the possible chemical space. Generative AI opens up the exploration of an astronomically larger number of potential drug candidates.\n*   **Accelerated Discovery:** Designing and synthesizing novel molecules from scratch, guided by AI, can significantly speed up the initial stages of drug discovery, which are often the bottleneck.\n*   **Design of Highly Optimized Drugs:** AI can engineer molecules with specific, tailored properties, potentially leading to more effective and safer drugs with fewer side effects.\n*   **Addressing \"Undruggable\" Targets:** For targets that have been difficult to drug with existing chemical modalities, de novo design offers a new avenue to discover molecules that can interact with them.\n\n**In essence, generative AI is transforming drug discovery from a process of searching and modification to one of intelligent, directed creation. It's like going from a treasure hunt to an architectural blueprint for building the perfect key.**\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're right to ask about the key players!

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
